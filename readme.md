## Project Requirements
 - Use a third-party API
 - Node / Express Web Server
 - MySQL Database, at least 2 tables
 - Use RESTful GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
 - Deployed using Heroku (with Data)
 - One NEW library, package, or technology we havenâ€™t discussed
 - Must have a polished front-end / UI (mobile first)
 - Folder structure meets MVC Paradigm (with /app folder for the app, /app/public for html, /app/routes for route info)
 - Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
 - Not expose sensitive API key information on the server


## Plan:
 - Fitness Hub (FitHub)
 - Eventbrite API to display fitness events
 - - Did not use Eventbrite API due to a sudden depreciation of their event search endpoint. See [This Link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/eventbrite-api/-E0MG7THMsc) for more info
 - Login system
 - Ability to connect trainers w/users
 - Ability to create workout routines
 - Ability to pin events and routines to their own list
 - - Have not found an event search API to replace eventbrite yet
